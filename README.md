# Invasion
This repository will contain all of the files used in the first game I developed as a project. 
The game is a simple arcade game where the player avoids collisions with multiple objects that
dynamically spawn above them in waves. As the player score increases, the spawn frequency 
increases which makes the game more and more difficult.
